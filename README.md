## About Me

I am a **Senior Penetration Tester** specialized in **adversary emulation, detection validation, and structured offensive operations** across web, infrastructure, identity, and cloud environments.

I conduct **realistic attack-path simulations** to evaluate exploitability, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and the effectiveness of defensive controls. My focus is **not just on finding vulnerabilities**, but on understanding **how attacks are detected, contained, and remediated** in operational environments.

I maintain **independent security research initiatives** to refine offensive methodologies, **controlled failure simulation techniques**, and telemetry-aware post-exploitation workflows — ensuring engagements produce **measurable defensive impact**.

My work intersects **Red Team operations, Detection Engineering, and Security Architecture**, helping organizations strengthen their resilience against sophisticated adversaries.

**Open to Senior Penetration Testing and Red Team engagements across US and EU organizations.**

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

This is **not a collection of exploits**.

This is a **capability portfolio showing how defensive technologies behave against realistic adversary behavior**.

Each repository represents a specific **defensive validation scenario**:

* Can your EDR detect stealth persistence?
* Can your SIEM correlate lateral movement?
* Can your IAM prevent trust abuse?
* Can your SOC identify command and control activity?

All activities are conducted under **defined Rules of Engagement** and **contractual authorization**.

## 🔬 Core Focus

> **Security is a continuous R&D process — adversaries evolve daily, defenses must evolve faster.**

I specialize in **Operational Adversary Emulation for security control validation**, simulating real threat actor behavior by engineering proprietary tradecraft designed to evaluate **EDR, SIEM, NGFW, IAM trust models, and API defenses**.

My work evaluates how organizations detect and respond to real attacker behavior:

* Can monitoring identify stealth persistence?
* Can identity controls prevent privilege escalation?
* Can segmentation stop lateral movement?
* Can SOC workflows contain an intrusion?
* Can incident response operate under pressure?

All research and tooling are used **exclusively during authorized security assessments** in controlled environments.

The objective is **not compromise** — the objective is **measurable defensive assurance**.
