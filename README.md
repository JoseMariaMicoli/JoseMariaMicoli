# Hi, I'm José María Micoli 🛡️💻

**Senior Red Team Operator | Offensive Security Engineer | Tradecraft Developer**

I specialize in simulating advanced threat actor behaviors by building custom offensive tooling. My focus is on moving beyond automated scanning to test organizational resilience through engineered bypasses and stealthy persistence.
