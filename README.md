## Engagement Outcomes

I help organizations understand whether their security controls actually work against real attacker behavior.

Typical deliverables include:

- Verified detection gaps across EDR/SIEM/XDR
- Lateral movement and identity boundary weaknesses
- Trust relationship abuse (AD / Cloud / CI-CD)
- Incident response readiness assessment
- Executive-ready risk evidence mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

This profile showcases the tradecraft and tooling used to generate those findings during authorized assessments.

## What this portfolio demonstrates

This is not a collection of exploits.

This is a capability portfolio showing how defensive technologies behave against realistic adversary behavior.

Each repository represents a specific defensive validation scenario:

- Can your EDR detect stealth persistence?
- Can your SIEM correlate lateral movement?
- Can your IAM stop trust abuse?
- Can your SOC identify command and control?

All activities are conducted under defined Rules of Engagement and contractual authorization.

## 🔬 CORE FOCUS

> **Security is a continuous R&D process — adversaries evolve daily, defenses must evolve faster.**

I specialize in **Operational Adversary Emulation for security control validation**, simulating real threat actor behavior by engineering proprietary tradecraft designed to evaluate defensive technologies such as EDR, SIEM, NGFW, and IAM trust models.

My work evaluates how organizations detect and respond to real attacker behavior:

* Can monitoring identify stealth persistence
* Can identity controls prevent privilege escalation
* Can segmentation stop lateral movement
* Can SOC workflows contain an intrusion
* Can incident response operate under pressure

All research and tooling are used exclusively during authorized security assessments and controlled environments under contractual permission.

The objective is not compromise — the objective is measurable defensive assurance.

## Professional Assessment Reporting

The reports in the portfolio are **professional penetration testing reports** created from controlled lab environments using Hack The Box infrastructure.

They demonstrate:

* Real audit structure and narrative
* Risk-based prioritization
* MITRE ATT&CK mapping
* Remediation guidance
* Executive communication

They are not CTF walkthroughs — they simulate deliverables provided to organizations.
